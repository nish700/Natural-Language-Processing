        "\n",
        "- Tokenization: NLTK offers various tokenization methods to split text into individual words or sentences. It includes options for word tokenization, sentence tokenization, and regex-based tokenization.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging: NLTK provides pre-trained models and algorithms for POS tagging, which assigns grammatical tags to words in a sentence, such as noun, verb, adjective, etc. These tags help in understanding the syntactic structure and meaning of text.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Named Entity Recognition (NER): NLTK supports NER, which involves identifying and classifying named entities, such as names of people, organizations, locations, and dates, within text data.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Sentiment Analysis: NLTK includes sentiment analysis capabilities, allowing you to analyze and determine the sentiment or opinion expressed in a piece of text, such as positive, negative, or neutral.\n",
        "\n",
        "- WordNet: NLTK integrates WordNet, a lexical database, which provides access to synonyms, antonyms, definitions, and semantic relationships between words. It allows you to explore word meanings and relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Stemming and Lemmatization: NLTK includes algorithms for stemming and lemmatization, which reduce words to their base or root forms. This can be useful for tasks like information retrieval and text normalization.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Corpus and Language Resources: NLTK provides a wide range of corpora and language resources for various languages, including text collections, lexical resources, and grammars. These resources can be used for training and evaluating models or conducting research.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Text Classification: NLTK supports text classification tasks, allowing you to train and evaluate classifiers for tasks like sentiment analysis, document categorization, or spam detection.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Language Processing Pipelines: NLTK provides a flexible framework for building language processing pipelines, where you can chain together multiple processing steps to perform complex NLP tasks."

        "\n",
        "Here are some key features and functionalities of Gensim:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Topic Modeling: Gensim offers an implementation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a widely used technique for uncovering latent topics in a collection of documents. It allows you to train LDA models on your own text data and extract topics along with their associated word distributions.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Word Embeddings: Gensim provides support for training and using word embeddings, which are dense vector representations of words that capture semantic similarities. It includes popular algorithms like Word2Vec and FastText, allowing you to train your own word embeddings or load pre-trained models.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Document Similarity: Gensim enables you to measure similarity between documents using techniques such as cosine similarity and the Word Mover's Distance (WMD). These methods allow you to quantify the similarity between two pieces of text based on their semantic content.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Text Preprocessing: Gensim provides utilities for common text preprocessing tasks, such as tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and stop-word removal. These preprocessing steps are essential for cleaning and preparing text data before applying various NLP algorithms.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Streaming and Memory Efficiency: Gensim is designed to handle large text corpora efficiently by using streaming and incremental processing methods. It allows you to process and train models on texts that may not fit entirely into memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Integration with Other Libraries: Gensim integrates well with other popular NLP libraries and tools. It can read and write data in various formats, including plain text, XML, and corpora in the well-known \"Bag-of-Words\" format. It also supports interoperability with libraries such as NLTK, scikit-learn, and spaCy."

These transactions turned out to be fraudulent. the information I was able to gathered turned out to be the tip of the iceberg. I was advised several ATM and Wire transactions totaling $ XXXXhad been completed over 30 transactions from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nThe next day my wife and I arrived at the local BBVA branch to make a claim for the unauthorized wire and ATM transactions. At that time the local banker advised the profile on my account had been changed. My contact telephone number had been changed, on-line banking was added to may account ( note : I had cancelled the on-line account when my parents passed away. The BBVA records will support there has not been an on-line account since XX/XX/XXXX ). In addition, PIN numbers had been changed/updated or added without my knowledge or consent. I have only one ATM card. \\n\\nIt became clear during my visit to the local branch someone had impersonanted my wife and the changes were complete. \\n\\nBased these facts I believe XXXX has a serious breach in there security and the responsibility of securing my funds or to vet any person who attempts to make the changes described above without the person \" personally \\'\\' going to the bank. \\n\\nLet me repeat.

I was advised I would need to return to the back to complete and notarize Affidavits for the Wire transfers. This was completed on XX/XX/XXXX. The affidavits were emailed to the fraud department before I left the bank on the 7th. \\n\\nThis is were the nightmare begins. Since that day BBVA personnel had never been upfront and honest when asked the question ... \\'\\' can you advise how, when and what occurred on or about XX/XX/XXXX when a person who claimed to be my spouse either called in to make the changes above. \\'\\' No response. I requested copies of any telephone recording on the day in question involving my account. No reply.

The replies come from inexperienced personnel in The Who read from scripts and have to reach outside to \" back offices \\'\\' for updates. Not once has a XXXX investigator contacted me to advise on XXXX part of their progress. \\n\\nI submitted a written complaint on XX/XX/XXXX to the president of the BBVA XXXX XXXX. I have never received a call or written acknowledgement from anyone! Also, we hand delivered a copy of this home office complaint to the local BBVA Branch in XXXX, CA. \\n\\nBut it gets better.

Form letters dated XX/XX/XXXX were finally received indicating credits for each transaction was provided. The form letter requested a return of a Written Statement of Unauthorized Debit. The form did not include when the form should be returned. When I contacted BBVA on XX/XX/XXXX to question the amounts noted on the cover letter I was advised I needed to return the form by XX/XX/XXXX or the Provisional deposits added to my account would be removed. Again NO ONE advised when I met with the personal banker on XX/XX/XXXX or on any of the numerous calls that this form needed to be completed and why then if the form was needed would my account be created without first returning a form BBVA Compass so desperately needed? \\n\\nWell I had to create a separate Word document with the dates of all the transactions and amounts, because the form letter did not provide enough space to list all of the transactions. The word document, a copy of the XX/XX/XXXX form letter and its attachments were mailed on XX/XX/XXXX in the self-addressed envelope provided by BBVA. I wanted to scan and email the information, but when I contacted the number on the form letter, BBVA was closed on Saturday XX/XX/XXXX and I need to call during normal business hours XXXX XXXX. \\n\\nThinking I had completed with everything BBVA required, I was shocked to received another form letter dated XX/XX/XXXX denying my claim and to advise ALL of the Unauthoized ATM I had claimed transactions were now considered Authorized based on their investigation and all provisional deposits would be removed on XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nI called the dispute department the morning of XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke to the representative and a supervisor and was told the Written Statement of Unauthorized Debit had not been received and I would have to start new new dispute and a new claim!!!!! BBVA would not open the same claim. In fact, and this is odd since BBVA is not open on Saturday the claim was closed on Saturday XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nAs far os the Wire transfer claim I have heard nothing and I am insulted by the attitude of BBVA the lack of empathy for an innocent customer and a victim of fraud. \\n\\nI am pleading with anyone who will this.

I went to my bank after receiving a payoff statement from Freedom Mortgage and sent a final wire transfer payment of {$24000.00} on XX/XX/2019. I was able to confirm everything was received through reviewing my account on-line with a Freedom Mortgage representative to confirm that everything was applied to my principal. Additionally, the representative confirmed on XX/XX/2019 that my account was closed out and my automatic monthly payment removed, as nothing else was owed. I took screen shots of the payments applied, as illustrated on their website. Then I received a letter dated XX/XX/2019 that indicated my pay-off was complete, my mortgage release documents were being processed and will be mailed to the County Clerk and that I should notify my insurance company and county tax authority to begin mailing statements directly to me. Additionally, I received a check dated XX/XX/2019 for my escrow ( taxes and insurance ). Then I arrived home from business & personnel travel on XX/XX/2019 and opened a new statement from Freedom Mortgage indicating I had a balance of {$51000.00}. I called Freedom Mortgage immediately the next day to try to understand what had happened. They indicated that my bank retracted a {$50000.00} payment on XX/XX/2019, and they re-instated my Loan account. They also added accrued interest and late payment charges. This story seemed far-fetched given my finance background, so I went online to review my XXXX bank statement only to notice that 3 {$50000.00} payments were pulled from Freedom Mortgage rather than the 4 I had authorized. As a result, I called Freedom Mortgage to tell them that something happened on their end since it showed they had collected all 4 payments but they had not pulled the last one from my bank. Then I set up a conference call with the customer service representative from Freedom Mortgage, my bank and I, as Freedom Mortgage continued to blame me and my bank for the mishap. Freedom Mortgage continued to tell me that I owed the accrued interest and remaining balance due. My bank told them that no fourth withdrawl of {$50000.00} was initiated by Freedom Mortgage, so Freedom Mortgage decided they would review the recorded authorizations they had on file with me & their service rep ( on XX/XX/2019 ). After reviewing the recording, they FINALLY agreed it was their fault and they will reverse the accrued interest. I told them I agreed that I owed {$50000.00} but no more ( no interest ) and they can pay my second wire transfer payment and any other fees to perform a 'second ' payoff. I requested a formal letter and payoff indicating that the only remaining amount I owe is {$50000.00} with no accrued interest or other fees, including that they will reimburse me for the second {$30.00} wire transfer I now have to pay my bank. Since this discussion on Thursday, XX/XX/2019, the payoff nor a letter has been sent to me to rectify the situation. I also had to place a stop payment with my bank to not pay the mortgage payment set to withdraw on XX/XX/2019, as I found out Freedom Mortgage illegally set up an automatic withdrawl from my bank after they re-instated my account on XX/XX/2019 without even contacting me to tell me they were re-instating it. I have been fully willing to wire the {$50000.00} as a final payoff but want a formal document from them stating it is my final payoff. Supposedly they are still 'working on it ' to resolve this issue ( since XX/XX/XXXX once they finally believed me ), but now I'm worried that I appear in 'default ' on my loan since I put a stop payment to Freedom Mortgage with my bank and worried my credit score will be in jeopardy, when ironically I was the one paying off my mortgage in full.

None can help explain why Flagstar keeps reversing the payments. Each time this happens I get charged a Returned check fee. Because no one at Flagstar can resolve the issues and my money was taken from the checking accounts to pay Flagstar but was not returned when they performed a Returned check I decided to payoff my loan. I don\\'t trust Flagstar to manage my loan anymore. \\n\\nIn XX/XX/XXXX, I follow the payoff procedures and obtained the Payoff value from Flagstar. With the payoff, Flagstar confirmed my loan was paid in full and the Deed of XXXX was sent to me with an Escrow refund. When I cashed the Escrow refund check, Flagstar had put a stopped payment on the refund check and told me I still owe them money. If I don\\'t pay then they will rescind the release of the mortgage/trust. \\n\\nBecause of the many reversed payments performed by Flagstar I feel they still have not returned all my money and that they still owe me money. I can not get anyone from Flagstar to work with me on the accounting for the money. They keep passing me to other people and each time it gets more confusing and more paperwork is required. \\n\\nAs of XX/XX/XXXX, I still don\\'t have my refund money.',\n",

              " 'Hello, I recently came to the conclusion of the scheduled payments of a {$55000.00} auto loan provided by Valley National Bank ( Acct : XXXX ) in XX/XX/2018. Upon receiving the final payoff statement, Valley National Bank incorporated over {$1000.00} of late payments and fees associated with payments which weren\\'t made on the exact due date of the loan over the life of the loan. I purchased my vehicle at a dealership and had I known that the financing bank, Valley National Bank, didn\\'t offer online payments I may have requested another lender ( if possible ), but nonetheless over the course of my loan term I admittedly didn\\'t always submit a wire request from my primary bank in time to have the funds to Valley National by the due date. So upon receiving the final payoff statement from Valley National which included {$55.00} of principal and {$1000.00} of late fees, I simply asked Valley National to provide me with a reconciliation of the {$1000.00} of late fees over the course of five years of payments so I could validate those {$1000.00} of late fees and/or additional interest. After being bounced around various departments at Valley National I was told by a collections XXXX that the statement had to be mailed and couldn\\'t be made available online. As I waited for the mailed copy to arrive, I continued to receive collection calls on the remaining principal balance and outstanding fees ( daily over the course of 2 weeks ). I assured the parties involved that I wasn\\'t declining to pay and would make payment arrangements upon receipt of the mailed materials. Over the next 2 weeks all I received from Valley National in the mail was further notices of the remaining principal balance and requested fees. At this point I called Valley National collections to again ask on the status of the requested reconciliation materials. I was told that the materials request was never made and that another department would have to handle reconciliations. Concerned, I asked to speak to a manager and urged her to please initiate the request for the materials so I could reconcile. I even offered to make a payment at the time for the remaining principal balance while I awaited the reconciliation materials so as to close out the loan without any negative impact upon my credit status. She assured me that no further collection actions would be taken, no late payment report would be made to the credit bureaus and assured me that the materials would be mailed over the next few days. Ten days later, I still had not received the materials in the mail and again called the company, at which point I was able to \" get to a person \\'\\' who had working knowledge of the fee reconciliation system. Rather than asking yet again for the reconciliation to be mailed, I just had her verbally read the day count and $ fees associated with the various payments which weren\\'t made on the due date over the course of the loan, at which point I agreed to pay the principal balance and fees in full, fully expecting that I would never receive a reconciliation in the mail. Days later I received the vehicle title in the mail and figured this was closure, however upon application for a refinance of my existing home loan ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I now discover that over the course of this whole ordeal, Valley National reported me as 30 days late two times for the unpaid {$55.00} balance, while all the while I was simply waiting for their reconciliation of late fees on the payoff notice to be provided to me. I contacted Valley National and asked them to please restate the report to the credit bureau given that my delays were related to an ask for a simple reconciliation of late fees over the course of a five year loan. Valley National declined to consider this and says \" what is done is done \\'\\'. Is there any remediation that can be taken at this point.

On XX/XX/XXXX, nineteen days after the date of XXXX debt collection letter, XXXX counsel XXXX sent XXXX a letter declaring that XXXX disputes your debt collection-related allegations, denies the same, and demands strict proof and verification thereof. Record at 21. As such, XXXX should have ceased his debt collection efforts immediately upon receiving that letter. Instead, XXXX proceeded to obtain a default judgment against XXXX on the debt collection claim before he had mailed XXXX the necessary verification and, thus, violated 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ). \\n\\nXXXX maintains, however, that there was no violation of the FDCPA because he sent adequate verification of the debt [ to XXXX ] in the XX/XX/XXXX notice of claim. Brief of Appellee at 13. Specifically, XXXX claims that a copy of the consumer credit contract between XXXX and American General attached to the notice of claim provided sufficient verification of the debt within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ). We can not agree. \\n\\nThe contract in no way provides sufficient verification of the debt. A review of the document reveals that it identifies only the terms of XXXX loan, including a 17.99 % annual interest rate and the original loan amount of {$2500.00}. The loan agreement contains no accounting of any payments made by XXXX, the dates on which those payments were made, the interest which had accrued, or any late fees which had been assessed once XXXX stopped making the required payments. Indeed, the existing unpaid contract balance at the time XXXX sent the debt collection notice was at least {$350.00} more than the original loan amount. Therefore, XXXX violated 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ) when he failed to cease collection of the debt by obtaining a default judgment against XXXX after XXXX had notified XXXX in writing that he was disputing the debt but before XXXX had mailed verification of the debt to XXXX. We reverse the trial courts entry of summary judgment in favor of XXXX on this issue. \\n\\nI notice that you are still reporting this collection on my credit report, which is considered to be a collection activity. You are now in violation of the FCPDA, and are now subject to fines of {$1000.00}, plus actual damages and attorneys fees, which I may collect from you by filing a claim in small claims court. These collections on my credit report are causing me severe problems in trying to purchase a home and the damage could lead into the $ 1000s. \\n\\nYou should also be aware that reporting such invalidated information to major credit bureaus might constitute defamation of character, as the negative marks on my credit report harm my credit and prevent me from enjoying all the benefits of good credit. In addition, the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) does not allow the inaccurate reporting of information on my credit report and under this act. Therefore, if you do not immediately remove this account from my credit report, you are subject to another {$1000.00} fine, plus punitive damages.

We took out a loan with XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. Due to a financial hardship in the XXXX of XXXX, we fell behind in our scheduled monthly payments. While in default an Assignment of Deed of Trust was executed on XX/XX/XXXX that purportedly granted all beneficial interest in the debt to XXXX , XXXX . as Trustee for a Trust. At the time this assignment was executed, the debt was contractually due for the XX/XX/XXXX payment. While still in default and due for the XX/XX/XXXX payment, the debt was purportedly transferred or assigned again to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as Trustee of a Trust. At that time we had no knowledge of these transfers. On XX/XX/XXXX, we received a letter from SLS informing us that the servicing of our debt obligation was being transferred to them effective XX/XX/XXXX. At the time SLS purportedly acquired the mortgage servicing the debt was contractually due for the XX/XX/XXXX payment. Over the past year, we have learned that pursuant to the FDCPA and the Rosenthal Act, SLS and XXXX as Trustee are \" debt collectors \\'\\' and not \" creditors \\'\\'. They are threatening and attempting to proceed with a nonjudicial action to dispossess us from our home without the legal right or authority to do so in violation of 15 U.S.C. 1692f ( 6 ) and California Civil Code 1788.17.  Despite numerous letters to them, they have failed to validate the debt and have failed to provide us with any documentation to demonstrate they have the legal ability to attempt to collect the debt, collect the debt, or enforce the power of sale contained in the deed of trust. Although we have taken legal action against them, they have not stopped their collection and enforcement activities. We are filing this Complaint to make the CFPB aware of their wrongful and illegal actions. The California Supreme Court has confirmed that a borrower is not entitled to pay an entity that is without the legal right and authority to collect and is enforce. In California only a creditor, or an agent of the creditor, may attempt to collect a debt or collect a debt and/or initiate and complete a foreclosure action. Based on information and belief, we believe SLS and XXXX are not creditors nor are they representatives of our true creditors. Falsely representing that the foreclosure documents are legal process is prohibited and misleading and is in violation of California Civil Code 1788.16. SLS and XXXX are engaging in acts that are causing substantial harm not only to us but to California consumers and taxpayers. They are continually attempting to collect a debt that is not due or owed to them. Immediate action must be taken to stop them from engaging in unfair competition. Their conduct is unlawful, unfair and deceptive. They are blatantly disregarding the FDCPA and the Rosenthal Act among other federal and state laws they are mandated to abide by. SLS and XXXX are not exempt from abiding by these statutes and must be held accountable for their misconduct.',\n",

First off, lets say i want to unfreeze my credit report a few months from now ( im not saying i do, im just using that as an example! ) could i even apply to a credit card for the next five years?

Could i have some extra details about that because tbh it seems a lot like i placed a freeze to help prevent my credit from being screwed over and then experian themselves XXXX me over.

I've received at least a dozen from experian since placing the freeze. Im not sure what experian thinks but to me thats extremely concerning, Why is that happening when experian themselves said it wouldnt happen? Is someone else applying for those cards? Does someone else have access to my experian account? ( the online account or even the experian account itself, like the one you look at! ) Theres alot of different ways that i can look at this but all i know for a fact are these 3 things. 1 : Even under the best circumstances, it just being someone at experian doing some type of typo or something like that, thats still really bad because they still arent suppossed to be doing that. Whats the point of the credit freeze if it apparently doesnt freeze? I guess experian doesnt care about identity theft. Come on, you cant blame me for thinking that way when it seems to be that way! 2 : Experian better get to the bottom of this and BE HONEST while doing it because if i find out experian screwed something up and then lied about it as well, I swear on my grave experian will be 100 % liable for any damages that might arise from that. 3 : If there is anything that screwed me over because of experians mistake, That will be an extremely bad day for experian in court.

The bank however continued to allow automatic electronic debits - I was charged by a previous vendor {$14.00}, days after I requested and was told the account was closed. A phone rep from TD who called my home about 2 months ago confirmed the same story. \\n\\nSince the bank allowed the charge to go through ( that they should not have ), every month they add new fees and charges. Now the balance is over $ 200+ which is almost entirely fees - due to their error. \\n\\nThey called me several times. A couple of months ago a rep called and confirmed my story. I told her that I was even willing to pay the {$14.00} from the charge that they shouldn't have allowed. I offered to pay the erroneous charge but told her I wouldn't pay any of their penalties. She said she'd put my on hold and ask her supervisor. She didn't come back, and I went to work. Several times they have called in the morning as I'm headed out to work, and I asked my wife to give them my cell # and if they would call me on it I would still try to resolve things with them.

They are denying my claim for fraudulent charges on my Wells Fargo Business Credit Card. I was alerted to this issue on XX/XX/2019, almost two full weeks after the card was reported stolen, was closed, and I was told not to worry about the charges by the representative.\\n\\nMy complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has many components which I have outlined below, but first and foremost it is regarding the denial of claim for fraudulent charges made on XX/XX/2019 totaling {$22000.00} USD that now I am being held responsible for. \\n\\nHelpful people from almost every other department and branch in Wells Fargo outside of the fraud the Wells Fargo Fraud Department, have expressed disgust, surprise, and utter disappointment that I am being held responsible for these charges. \\n\\nGiven the evidence supplied in the Credit Card Fraud Evidence document attached to this complaint, as well as the simple fact that their own team approved the fraud claims on my Wells Fargo Business Debit card, there is no reason to close and deny my claim. The only acceptable resolution is that all of these charges be permanently removed from my account for the Wells Fargo Business Credit Card in dispute. \\n\\nI have further complaints in the matter regarding the manipulative, unhelpful, untimely, strong-arm tactics that that fraud team resorted to when the denial was issued. I was immediately made out to be the criminal, despite being the innocent party who has been a long a valued customer. Im asking for a full review and investigation of practices used to deliver or address customers who have had a denial of fraud claims and an apology for the conduct of the fraud team. It is my opinion and the opinion of those I have spoken to within Wells Fargo at various levels that this specifically due to the dollar value of the fraud and that my claim has been denied without a proper investigation of the facts before denying the claim. \\n\\nAdditionally, in the case of fraud and a police investigation into the charges, time matters. After repeated questions to the representatives who handled my case on XX/XX/XXXX, I was repeatedly told that I didnt need to worry about anything and that the charges were obvious fraud and that Wells Fargo would take care of everything. Nearly two weeks later, after I called to inquire why the fraudulent charges were placed back on my card, they suggested that I would need to potentially provide unlimited and unspecified amounts of evidence to support my case. I was also told that no matter what evidence I supplied, there would be no guarantee of any results that would positively affect the decision in my favor. This is a tactic that I believe was used to stall and make the task seem insurmountable, demeaning, and potentially fruitless in order to scare and intimidate the customer from pursuing further action. However, I immediately supplied the evidence I could gather as a civilian and launched additional police reports beyond the initial XXXX XXXX Sheriff 's report for the theft of my wallet, cards, and phone from my vehicle on XX/XX/2019. There are currently several police departments across various locations where the charges occurred investigation the matter. The fraud team repeated claims theyre unable to supply the transaction times necessary to the ongoing investigation, hampering the multiple active and ongoing police investigations. Yet the fraud supervisor read off several transaction times to me on the phone when we originally spoke. I still have yet to receive a call back from the original supervisor I had called regarding the issue, nearly a week after leaving a message with him. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/2019 I spoke to two representatives in the resolution department related to my case, who promised that it would be escalated and the team would be actively working to get the denial reversed and the investigation reopened. Yet, on Monday, XX/XX/2019 when I called again, the case had yet to be assigned. When I spoke with the new representative, she took on the case, but made no promises and was sorry someone told me incorrectly that they had the power to do what the previous representative had stated. After supplying all of the evidence, I called back two hours later, only to find the representative had still failed to contact the internal fraud department, and therefore I opted to begin contacting federal authorities and watchdog groups about the case. \\n\\nRESOLUTION : Again, the only acceptable resolution is that all of the fraudulent charges filed be permanently removed from my account for the Wells Fargo Business Credit Card in dispute and that any negative marks on my business or personal credit or accounts be removed. \\n\\nA resolution does not mean that I will not continue to pursue action against Wells Fargo for the losses and harm this has caused to my business, my family, and my health. Additionally, it does not mean that I will not also pursue action to stop the abhorrent practices of Wells Fargo related to denial of claims without proper investigation. What has happened to me should never happen to anyone again. \\n\\nI have attached the list of fraudulent charges, Credit Card Fraud Evidence supplied to Wells Fargo, and additional Well Fargo complaint documentation with notes I have been keeping to build the case against Wells Fargo and support my claim.\",\n",

First, they harassed me with letters during the period when I requested my validation of debt, but never received it. I reported that and afterwards, they finally sent me the letter. Then, they only sent me a letter stating that they would put this debt on my credit report, but was not harassing the other person involved and I believe this was a scare tactic because I have young credit, so they saw that as an opportunity to get me to pay this debt off quickly. They were only targeting me with this debt and not the person with a longer credit history. Once I got the letter, I immediately called to make a payment plan with a man who was over my case. I let him know that I was a college student and could not afford a lump sum or to make larger payments. I spoke to two men and I believe it was either in XXXX, XXXX or XXXX. But during those months I had been communicating with them. The first man lied to me in the middle of our conversation. He said once I made the {$250.00} payment plan, that he would take the eviction off of my record and by the end of the conversation he contracted that statement and said I would have to wait until I paid off of the debt. A month later, I called in to lower that payment to {$100.00} and the second man I spoke with told me that if I paid a lump sum of {$3000.00} that the debt wouldn't be put on my credit and that they would remove the debt from my record. These conversations were all recorded and can be used as evidence. He told me that once I come up with the lump sum that I could pay it off and that until then I would pay the {$100.00}. I stopped that plan once I reported to the CFPB that they were adding add fees to my account making my payments useless and then the debt became disputed. I have worked hard these months to come up with the {$3000.00} lump sum on my own, as a struggling college student. Today, I called to pay this debt off with the half amount we spoke about. I spoke with someone new who was on my case and she told me that the other guy no longer worked there and she had taken over my case. Again, I do not know if this is true or not, because they lied about everything today. Eventually, I spoke with the supervisor, XXXX, who was very abusive in her language towards me. She was very disrespectful and blatantly lied. She lied about the total of my debt and said we owed {$8000.00}. Now nowhere in my record does is it say I owe that much money and they have not sent me a single letter saying I owed that much. She said that the cost came from the apartment, but that was not true because we have court records of all the charges that came from XXXX Apartments and if it reached to {$8000.00} that is coming from this debt collection agency. She was not transparent about how much the debt collection agency was trying to profit off of my debt. She made it seem like I had no other option, but to pay the debt in full and from my previous conversations, I know that to be a lie. She said that they would not take this off of my credit and even with a partial payment they wouldn't, and from my previous conversations, I know that to be a lie. She also made up some random discount of 10 %, which is nothing. She said that she could speak to disrespectfully if she wanted to and could talk me to me however she pleased and I know that to also be lie due to FDA regulations. Throughout the whole conversation she was antagonizing me. She said I couldn't pay half, but would not give me an explanation as to why, which also makes me believe she was lying. According to the FDA, her behavior was illegal : falsely represent the amount you owe or the amount of compensation the collection agency will receive. She was not trying to collect a debt, only bullying, lying and verbally abusing me. She was forcing me to pay a higher amount than I knew I had to.

Again, we requested that the account be frozen, and I was told that this would not be necessary, that the issue was a pretty standard claim that would be resolved easily. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/2019, while waiting for a resolution, we noticed more unauthorized activity someone was trying to connect an unknown XXXX account to our bank account and made verification deposits and withdrawals. This attempt was denied by XXXX, but we again went to the same bank branch and reported the issue. This time we were served by XXXX XXXX, and this is where things got even more unbelievable. The associate said OK, let 's have your telephone and we'll call claims. We didn't understand and asked for clarification. The employee explained that it would be faster to call from a customer 's cellular telephone than to go through the main system. THIS IS LUDICROUS. We were visiting a bank branch because we had been victims of fraud possibly originating from cellular telephone hacks and we were asked to use our possibly compromised telephones rather than the bank 's which would be assumed to be more secure! We denied this and used the bank 's telephones! When Claims were contacted by the associate, they stated that they could not find a record of a fraud claim ( which was done on our first visit on XX/XX/2019 ) and that a new claim would have to be made for all the unauthorized transactions. A new claim was made. This time, a number was provided XXXX. \\n\\nI SPECIFICALLY ASKED THE ASSOCIATE why they could not just cancel or deny the unauthorized transactions, which were still pending, and she said once they are initiated, they can not be stopped. This is also absolutely untrue! \\n\\nSensing that something was wrong, we trusted out instinct and withdrew the bulk amount of the money in the account in the form of a cashier 's check. We left a small amount of money in the account ( {$230.00} ) to cover some legitimate payments which had already been initiated PRIOR to the fraud. \\n\\nAgain, we waited. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/2019, again, an unauthorized transaction attempt was noticed. Someone attempted a XXXX transaction in the amount of {$1900.00}, and our account was now NEGATIVE!!! \\nHow the XXXX do you even authorize something like this from an account which by now obviously did not even have the funds and to top it off you were already notified of fraudulent activity!!!??? \\n\\nAGAIN, we went to our bank and were assisted by XXXX but in an office labeled XXXX XXXX. \\nThis time, the associate contacted someone who was able to cancel this transaction. He stated that the previous transactions also could have been cancelled but the employee who helped me obviously did not know how to do that and he wished he had been the one helping me, he would have done it. We were, by now in complete shock at this TOTAL CHAOS. \\n\\nXXXX was able to contact Fraud Operations who placed a HOLD on the account in the form of negative XXXX ( XXXX ), again we were told not to panic, the issue would be resolved in 10 days. \\n\\nThe branch manager XXXX told us WE DON'T DO FRAUD HERE, THIS IS A BANK BRANCH THAT ONLY DEALS IN EVERYDAY TRANSACTIONS and DON'T WORRY, THESE THINGS HAPPEN ALL THE TIME!!! Very comforting indeed! \\n\\nSo again we waited. \\n\\nToday is XX/XX/2019, our account is still frozen, NO REFUND HAS BEEN MADE, the three legitimate transactions we made prior to the fraud ( payment to XXXX {$100.00}, payment to XXXX {$25.00} and a check for {$77.00} ) were returned, resulting in issues with the payees, and NO ONE from the bank has either contacted us, or even apologized for that matter. The only thing we received were overdraft notices and e-mails. \\n\\nWe sent 2 letters to the bank in writing - one to the customer service address on out statements in XXXX, FL and one to the corporate office in XXXX, NC. \\n\\nNO COMMUNICATION WHATSOEVER BY THE BANK!!! NO RESOLUTION!!! NO RECOVERY OF OUR MONEY!!!\",\n",

What this filing is about is Experian not correcting information that they can see with their own eyes is erroneous. \\n\\nA couple of months ago - possibly closer to three - I filed a dispute against XXXX with Experian regarding an error on my credit report. ( I have not yet seen whether this also appears on XXXX  or XXXX  reports, but I will find that out shortly ). \\n\\nWhile XXXX is the culprit for not reporting over {$3000.00} in payments they\\'ve received from me in the last year and a half, Experian is complicit in refusing to recognize a blatant mathematical impossibility. I have received no correspondence whatsoever related to the results of the dispute, not from Experian nor the creditor. I see nothing on the report that shows that any change has been made - no comments, no anything ( I\\'ve asked them to direct me to where that is if I\\'m simply looking in the wrong place, but they have offered no help whatsoever in that regard ). \\n\\nOver the past year and a half I have sent XXXX {$150.00} a month ( this figure is the result of a payment agreement I came to with XXXX that they chose to remove me from, but that I nevertheless stayed true to ). These payments have cleared the bank and have been applied to the balance. Yet the report is showing that no payments have been made for the past 20 months! \\n\\nI noticed when about to submit this that it says I will not be able amend it later with any documentation. While I\\'m not prepared to do that at the moment, it really isn\\'t necessary to provide proof of the payments because on the very same report, it shows that the balance has gone down by the total of the payments ( and it will have reduced even further by the time you get to this, as another payment just went out ). Yet XXXX refuses to acknowledge this and has even written off the balance as a bad debt ( I\\'m assuming that\\'s what \" charge-off \\'\\' means ). \\n\\nBoth things can\\'t be true - that XXXX has not been receiving payments AND that the balance is being reduced. I know with certainty my credit score is suffering from this. Just last week Experian itself sent me an alert that I dropped from the \" good \\'\\' to \" fair \\'\\' range, even citing the XXXX issue as the reason! \\n\\nFrom here on in, if XXXX would like the reality to be that it\\'s a bad debt that is not being paid down so they can write if off, then they should decline the payments. Or I will oblige them by stopping the payments, but I must hear that from them first. \\n\\nAs an aside, I am unable to access any of this through XXXX. They no longer send me statements and from what I can tell, have removed me from their customer database altogether - there is no account for me to log in to. This is also something that needs to be changed, so that I can keep a closer eye on things. \\n\\nIt\\'s no secret that the bureaus receive most of their revenue from the creditors - how the government allows such a conflict of interest to go on is mind-boggling. \\n\\nApologies for lack of brevity. \\n\\n\\nThanks for your time, XXXX XXXX',\n",

I asked for deferment for 9 months - 1 year, and all she said was are you able to make the payment to catch your loan up? I asked her why no one has tried to call and tell me any of this and why I had been told that I would have a new payment plan so many times and she just kept saying she apologized for the inconvenience. I have been promised 3 different times a new repayment plan. And now there could possibly be a delinquent report on my credit.

              " \"Summary : Our mortgage company 's property loss division is refusing to release funds to us following the completion of repairs on our home that was damaged during Hurricane Florence. \\nThe mortgage company, XXXX XXXX XXXX, utilizes XXXX to handle their loan servicing, and the customer service we have received thus far has been unacceptable. They do not communicate important information and you can not speak with any management there directly unless they call you. \\n\\nOn or about XX/XX/XXXX we reported storm damage to our home resulting from Hurricane Florence to our insurer ( XXXX ) and our mortgage company ( XXXX XXXX ). An adjuster was sent out shortly thereafter and a report was made that resulted in the issuance of a check in early XX/XX/XXXX for {$24000.00} to begin repairs. The check was taken to an office of XXXX XXXX to be endorsed so we could deposit the funds. When we returned to the home after the evacuation, we discovered additional damage not noted by the adjuster. We worked with a storm mitigation company, XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX, FL, to demolish and clean the storm damaged portions of our home. This required the removal of significant drywall, insulation, and flooring. The insurer paid XXXXXXXX XXXX  XXXX {$27000.00} directly in XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, the insurer also paid {$13000.00} to us directly for flooring repairs and another check that was sent to XXXX XXXX for endorsement. It too was endorsed and returned to us for deposit. \\n\\nOn or about XX/XX/XXXX, we submitted our final settlement request to our insurer to cover the remaining damage. At this time, we were about 90 % complete so we sent a request to XXXX XXXX to schedule an inspection. Our request was canceled but no one called us to explain why nor to even notify us of the cancellation. We contacted XXXX  on or about XX/XX/XXXX to inquire about the inspection and the agent was unable to explain what happened. However, we learned that XXXX now wanted significantly more documentation and agreements to be signed before they would process our claim. We submitted additional documentation at that time that explained the basis for the entire claim amount ( {$84000.00} after deductible in total ) and put in a second inspection request at that time which also inexplicably was cancelled. \\n\\nIn early XXXX, I spoke with another agent and requested that I receive a call from a manager. Two days later, a XXXX manager, XXXX XXXX, contacted me and explained that they needed additional information from us. We identified what should be provided by the insurance company and I contacted our adjuster who forwarded the letter on the same day ( XX/XX/XXXX ). This was submitted to XXXX at their web site. Shortly thereafter, XXXX   informed me that the information was not what they needed and they wanted additional information. XXXX contacted the insurance company adjuster directly to speak with them. The insurance company again forwarded the requested information. Our insurance agent also contacted XXXX  on our behalf to get this matter resolved. On or about XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted a third request to XXXX for an inspection. At this point we are essentially 100 % completed on our repairs. This too was canceled without notice or explanation. Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted the mortgage company and spoke to XXXX regarding this matter. She tried to help me but said she needed to get a letter from the insurance company regarding the basis for two of the payments ( {$13000.00} and {$19000.00} checks ). She called and spoke to XXXX at my insurer and said that they would be sending a letter today and that it would take 24-48 hours before it would be available for review on XXXX  system. At this point, I dont have confidence that this will result in an inspection being scheduled. \\n\\nMy understanding is that under the law, the mortgage company can not retain funds once the insured property has achieved 100 % completion of repairs. I do not understand how XXXX can continue to engage in these practices.\",\n",

              " 'Hello. My story is sad but true. It\\'s like millions of others, I\\'m sure but still no less sad because it is my own issue. My own life \\'s issue. I am an XXXX and I pursued my dream of being an XXXX  when I went to college, XXXX University, and then was accepted into the prestigious XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX   Graduate XXXX Program at XXXX. It was a great program and one where students were afforded many professional opportunities that many XXXX who hadn\\'t gone to school didn\\'t receive. I had received {$40000.00} in scholarship money to attend XXXX and I borrowed another {$40000.00} to pay for living expenses and the tuition difference for the next three years. In addition to the {$10000.00} I had taken out for XXXX study from XXXX, in XXXX I was {$50000.00} in debt with principal at 8.25 % interest. I also had taken out a Perkins loan for {$2500.00} that I had paid off within five years of graduation. After graduating XXXX, I worked in theater steadily for the next three years. My salary at $ XXXX week wasn\\'t tremendous but I was a working XXXX! After the 6 month grace period however my loan servicer, then Sallie Mae, told me I would owe $ XXXXmonth on top of my rent and bills but if that would be a problem they said I could defer payments for upto 2 years or I could \" forbear \\'\\' payments, essentially stopping payments, basically so I would not have to worry about payments. As the years went by I had to keep forbearing or deferring payments. My loans were bought and sold as so much trash by XXXX, Navient, Sallie Mae, and finally Navient again. I\\'m sure there were other servicers who bought the loans but I can not rememember all of them. They seemed to change each or every other year. I would constantly ask for statements at the end of the deferrment period to see how much interest was \\'capitalized \\' to the principal but most of the servicer \\'s employees were from XXXX and either they didn\\'t understand what I meant when I said, \" Please send me a paper statement when the loan is about to start repayment so I can see how much interest has accrued \\'\\' or they just disregarded it as unimportant. It was probably the latter as I\\'m sure many of us asked for statements but because the loans had switched hands so much the servicers only needed to get permission to defer or forbear payments and then forget about the rest of the service call. Their bank was getting what they wanted. People whose initial principal wasn\\'t enormous, although owing {$50000.00} is pretty enormous would see the balance balloon to enormous sums because we weren\\'t being kept aware of how the principal kept growing. The agents were always so understanding and supportive on the call about giving out more deferment or forbearance time because we needed help. Outside of paying my rent on a New York rent stabilized apt , borrowing for school has been my only borrowing experience. Fast forward to some years later when I was in a long running play, or on tour and I would have a modest steady income and I would try and knock off some of the principal but the interest alone now was over {$1000.00} so I asked about repayment options. I was put on income sensitive plans or income contingent plans and had some years where I was able to pay some of the loan \\'s interest back but unfortunately those plan were not the \\'right income sensitive \\' plan to qualify for payments towards loan forgiveness. Once again, misleading information that is only found out years later when the issue is too big now to be ignored and I\\'m trying to figure out a way out of this mess. As it stands right now I have about two, maybe three years towards loan forgiveness. My principal is now {$90000.00}! I am in the \" REPAYE \\'\\' plan which I need to reapply for each year. This year my payment was $ XXXX month based on my expenses and income from the previous year however I\\'m still not paying anything toward taking down the principal so the interest gets added to the amount and the amount keeps growing. I\\'m XXXX years old. Still an XXXX. I make around XXXX/year between XXXX work, side gigs like XXXX, and unemployment but it changes every year and I don\\'t receive a weekly check like a banker. I get paid for something then I have to stretch that money out to pay health insurance/medical costs, union dues, not to mention rent, bills and the occasional piece of pizza. I live in XXXX which is very expensive. I have under {$10000.00} in retirement savings and with streaming media taking away a lot of union work XXXX in commercials things have been getting worse and worse in the last 5 years. Producers and ad agencies don\\'t care about XXXX. There aren\\'t government regs to restrict this from happening and our union is virtually a non factor in protecting our livliehood. I yearn for a night when I can sleep through without waking up in an anxious sweat. I have this {$90000.00} debt hanging over my head with no real possibility to pay it off in my lifetime. I\\'m wondering how I could have let this happen but more importantly, I\\'m wondering why there aren\\'t any regulations in place to protect borrowers from this sort of practice. The \\'ever polite and supportive bank who says, \" You can have another forbearance, no problem \\'\\'. Additionally, had I been told about the \" proper \\'\\' repayment plan to be on years ago, I would have a few more years invested in the loan forgiveness program and I would not be staring down this dark tunnel. Had their practices been less predatory in a \\'folksy kind of way \\' but instead \\'transparent in an honest way \\', I would not be 25 years out of graduate school looking at double the amount I borrowed with not very good prospects to pay it all off.',\n",

During this time, I was also a Nordstrom Loyalty customer, and I regularly received reward certificates for my spending. \\n\\nIn XXXX, in XXXX XXXX, I made a {$1200.00} purchase for a business trip to XXXX. I was traveling a lot for work and out of the country, so when I finally returned home, I received my XXXX statement in the mail, and I realized I was two days late in paying my bill, so I used the automated phone service Nordstrom has to pay a bill online ( this is a 24/7 bill pay phone number at XXXX ). \\n\\nI paid the amount in full on XX/XX/XXXX, and I immediately received an automated billing confirmation number and payment proof was also received in writing when reflected on my next Nordstrom statement ( SEE ATTACHMENT # 1 and # 2 indicating payment on XX/XX/XXXX while a late fee for {$37.00} was assessed and charged on the same day payment was due - redacted for this version ). \\n\\nWhen I received my following months statement, 2 statements later, not only did the payment show as adjusted and reversed, but I had received a collections notice, too, indicating that my account had gone to collections and was now reported to all credit agencies ( ATTACHMENTS # 3 and # 4 - redacted for this version ). \\n\\nWhen I contacted the collection agency, they did not understand the issue, so they had to patch in someone from customer service at Nordstrom, whose name was XXXX XXXX ( not her real name, Im sure ).
